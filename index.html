      <p class="category-details"><br>I have been learning to speak, and read Spanish since I was in Kindergarden. I attended a Spanish Immersion school, and continued to learn Spanish through Junior High and Highschool, becoming fluent according do the standards of Advanced Placement, and International Baccalaureate.<br><br>I believe this will be of use, as I have experience learning new languages - learning to code is similar, as you must learn the context of each phrase, and apply it in a logical manner.</p>
      <p class="primary-titles">Design Skills | <span class="location">Art and Design</span></p>
      <p class="category-details">During my first year at college, as well as in Highschool I took classes centered around art and design. I became proficient in the Adobe Suite, especially Photoshop, Premiere, and After Effects. I explored different styles, and believe to have found my own for the time being. I hope to reflect my personal style and originality in all my work. <br><br>I believe these skills will become useful as I learn to code, because part of coding is understanding different aesthetics (especially when producing a product for a client). Also, I found that I was able to understand new programs relatively quickly, which will help me to keep on track with the program.</p>
